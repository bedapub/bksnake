Read processing
===============


FASTQ files were quality checked with FastQC version "fastqc_version" (Andrews et al. 2010).

Optional : Raw read sequencines were trimmed with Cutadapt version "cutadapt_version" (parameters) prior to mapping (Martin 2010).

RNASeq "library_type" reads were mapped onto the "species_name" genome (build "species_id") with STAR read aligner version "star_version" using default mapping parameters (Dobin et al. 2012).

Aligned reads were quality checked with Picard tools (Broad Institute) and MultiQC version "multiqc_version" (Ewels et al. 2015). 

Numbers of mapped reads for all "RefSeq/Ensembl/Gencode" transcript variants of a gene were combined into a single value (i. e. count) assuming "count_tool_strand" library by featureCounts from the Subread package version "featureCounts_verison" (parameters) and normalized as "countMethod (countMethodDesc).
